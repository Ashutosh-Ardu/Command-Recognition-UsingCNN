# Command-Recognition-UsingCNN
In this project we identify commands using real time audio input and use this to move an object like ui element in a game in case of software application or a robot in case of hardware application. 
### Model Building/Training - [`Colab`](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XaTSZGzVYQpaLRyFmyfgAgJYYml79OmJ?usp=share_link)


## Audio Dataset - 
[`mini_speech_commands`](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/speech_commands)

## Instructions
- Make sure to use the correct `commands` order in `project.py` (same as when running the Colab)
- Install pyaudio and tensorflow
- Use the correct and most accurate `saved_model` from colab.
- Run `python project.py`

## Demonstration Video

- `output.wav` is the real time input which was recorded by the project.
